# NotSoManager
Steam account manager created for those who launch steam in a non-standard way (for example, using loaders for cheats).

### Information
It is displayed automatically when the Steam authorization window appears.  
This manager uses pixelscan to enter data into authorization fields.  
It can either enter data into the already open Steam window, and start and restart steam itself to change the account.
